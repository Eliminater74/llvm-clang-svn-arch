# llvm-svn

This is a fork of the already nice [llvm-svn](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/llvm-svn/) PKGBUILD from Arch Linux AUR. The fork makes the switch to cmake in lieu of autotools, and supports out-of-source builds.

## TODO

* Although the PKGBUILD works (or at least pretends to), lots of things still need refining.
